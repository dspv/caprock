# Caprock — Decisions

The ADR log: decisions that are closed, with the reasoning that closed them. **Check this file before reopening anything.** A decision reversed without a new ADR is not a decision, it is drift.

Format: what was decided, what it rules out, and what would justify revisiting it. ADR-001…008 and ADR-010…012 were settled in the spec (resolved 2026-08-18; ADR-012 comes from task T2's wording). ADR-009 and ADR-013…018 were made while preparing this repo for development on 2026-08-18 and are **marked "repo-prep decision"** — Dima can overrule any of them.

---

## ADR-001 — Name: Caprock, hosted at caprock.dev

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

The brand, the domain, and the "honest measurement" reputation from the Python measurer carry over; the launch story is "Caprock's big brother", not a cold start.

**Rules out:** fortem.dev (off-topic SEO authority, brand mixing with the ECS product); any new name.

**Revisit if:** open-core happens and an org-level brand is needed — even then caprock.dev stays as product domain or redirect.

---

## ADR-002 — License: Apache-2.0

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Consistent with the existing Caprock, and carries a patent grant.

**Rules out:** MIT (the corpus template's default LICENSE was MIT and was replaced), AGPL/BSL/source-available.

**Revisit if:** the open-core decision ([ADR-005](#adr-005--monetization-free-oss-through-phases-01-open-core-deferred-solo-mode-free-forever)) requires a different license for a paid tier — the solo/local core stays Apache-2.0 regardless.

---

## ADR-003 — UI stack: React + Vite, embedded in the Go binary via `go:embed`

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Single-binary distribution is preserved: `go build` yields one file per OS that serves the SPA at `/`. The only thing Electron buys is bundling Chromium; a Go daemon + browser tab gives the same UI with zero ABI pain, one `go build` per platform, and the option of a TUI later.

**Rules out:** Electron; a separately deployed frontend; native-addon dependencies of any kind.

**Revisit if:** a desktop wrapper is wanted for Phase 3 — Tauri/Wails is a *packaging* decision layered on top, not an architecture change.

---

## ADR-004 — Observe-only for externally started sessions: yes, it is the Phase 0 wedge

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

The much larger population runs `claude` in a terminal today and wants to see what it's doing and costing without adopting a runtime (traceability #7). The user-level hook shim + transcript tailing captures every session on the machine.

**Rules out:** requiring sessions to be spawned by Caprock to be visible; per-project-only hook registration as the default.

**Revisit if:** the user-level registration proves too intrusive in launch feedback — a per-project mode would be added, not substituted.

---

## ADR-005 — Monetization: free OSS through Phases 0–1; open-core deferred; solo mode free forever

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Adoption friction is the enemy at launch; the trust story is "local-first, zero servers, runs on the subscription you already pay for". The open-core (team/cloud tier) decision waits for post-Phase-2 traction.

**Rules out:** paywalls, license keys, telemetry, or "phone home" of any kind in Phases 0–2; any pricing page before traction exists.

**Revisit if:** Phase 2 ships and there is measurable pull for team/cloud features. Solo/local mode stays free permanently — this part is not revisited.

---

## ADR-006 — PTY backend: ConPTY-capable wrapper behind our own `ptyman` interface

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted (backend candidate pending T0 spike)

`creack/pty` is POSIX-only. First candidate is `aymanbagabas/go-pty` (delegating to `creack/pty` on POSIX, ConPTY on Windows) behind our own `ptyman` interface so the backend is swappable; a one-day spike (T0) confirms it builds and passes a smoke test on all three OS. Windows startup failure is exactly where the incumbent bleeds users.

**Rules out:** shipping any PTY code that has not passed the Windows matrix job; a POSIX-only Phase 1.

**Revisit if:** the T0 spike fails on Windows — then evaluate ConPTY directly via `golang.org/x/sys/windows`; the `ptyman` interface stays.

---

## ADR-007 — The harness *is* Caprock: new Go codebase in `dspv/caprock`; Python measurer frozen

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Python is wrong for a long-running daemon owning PTYs and the Headroom dependency ties the roadmap to an upstream built for a different purpose; a mission-control daemon must own its ingest path. The brand, cost/cache math, and JSONL knowledge port over (rewrite, not wrap). Personal profile for the launch story and portfolio visibility; transferable to an org later if open-core happens. The Python repo is archived read-only; published PyPI versions keep working.

**Rules out:** pivoting Caprock-python in place; wrapping the Python code; carrying Headroom.

**Revisit if:** never for the language choice; the repo location moves to an org only if open-core happens.

---

## ADR-008 — Hooks are the source of truth for activity; single normalized event stream

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Two data planes (terminal bytes, hook events) plus transcript accounting all normalize into one `Event` type consumed by the UI, stats, orchestrator, and any future avatar skin. Hooks are real-time and tool-level; transcripts lag but carry token usage; PTY bytes are the last-resort fallback.

**Rules out:** parsing PTY output to infer activity when hooks are available; per-consumer event shapes.

**Revisit if:** Anthropic ships a first-party structured activity stream that supersedes hooks — then it becomes another source feeding the same `Event`.

---

## ADR-009 — Hook transport is the `caprock-hook` shim binary, not Claude Code's native http hook type

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision (verified against the hooks reference the same day)*

Claude Code now supports `{"type":"http","url":…}` hooks that POST the same JSON directly. That would remove one binary — but on connection failure (daemon not running) Claude Code surfaces a `<hook name> hook error` notice in the user's transcript on every event. Caprock's trust contract says a stopped daemon must be invisible to the user's session; only a shim that swallows failures and exits 0 delivers that. The shim also gives us the Phase 2 Stop-decision request-response with a hard 5s budget and stdout control.

**Rules out:** registering `type: "http"` hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` in v0.x.

**Revisit if:** Claude Code adds a "silent on failure" option for http hooks, or the shim's install/uninstall proves to be a support burden.

---

## ADR-010 — Hive state lives in files; the router is the single git committer; the Stop hook is the autonomy engine

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Plain files over cleverness: mailboxes and task state are markdown/JSON on disk, inspectable with `cat`; SQLite mirrors them for the UI and is rebuildable by rescan. Agents never run git on the hive repo — one writer avoids merge conflicts and gives a clean ledger. Forcing continuation via the Stop hook (`decision: block`) uses a mechanism Claude Code already honours, with a hard loop-guard.

**Rules out:** database-only task state; agents committing to the hive; a bespoke agent API for orchestration.

**Revisit if:** file-based mailboxes hit a concurrency or scale wall in real use (many agents, high message rate).

---

## ADR-011 — One server, one port (default 4173), per-run bearer token; loopback only

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

`/v1/hook`, the REST API, the WebSocket, and the UI share one listener on `127.0.0.1:4173`; `runtime.json` carries `{port, token}` for the shim. Unix sockets are not portable to Windows; a single loopback listener with a random per-run token is the same code on all OS and keeps everything local.

**Rules out:** Unix-domain-socket hook transport; binding non-loopback interfaces; a separate hook port.

**Revisit if:** a remote/team mode is ever built (post open-core decision) — that would be a new listener with real auth, not a change to this one.

---

## ADR-012 — SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go); no CGO anywhere

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted

Keeps CGO off and cross-compilation trivial: one runner builds static binaries for three OS. A CGO SQLite would reintroduce the toolchain/ABI failure class we are explicitly avoiding.

**Rules out:** `mattn/go-sqlite3`; any dependency that requires a C toolchain.

**Revisit if:** a measured performance problem in the event write path cannot be solved with batching/WAL — unlikely at Caprock's write rates.

---

## ADR-013 — Data dir and config conventions

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

Data dir = `os.UserConfigDir()/caprock` (macOS `~/Library/Application Support/caprock`, Linux `~/.config/caprock`, Windows `%AppData%\caprock`), overridable via `CAPROCK_DATA_DIR`. It holds `caprock.db`, `runtime.json` (0600), the installed `caprock-hook` binary, an optional user `pricing.json` override, and `config.json` (loop-detector K/T, auto-pause opt-in, port). Chosen because it is what the Go standard library resolves per OS with no extra dependency, and it keeps everything a user might want to delete in one place.

**Rules out:** dotfiles scattered in `$HOME`; writing anything into the user's project directories except the hive (Phase 2, explicitly registered by the user).

**Revisit if:** users ask for XDG-strict paths on macOS — a `CAPROCK_DATA_DIR` override already covers it.

---

## ADR-014 — Commit to `master` directly until Phase 0 T6, then PRs

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

The spec's "every task = one PR" rule is right once there is a running product to protect. During bootstrap (docs migration, T1 scaffold, T2 store, T3 hookd/shim, T4 ingest, T5 rollup, T6 api) there is one contributor, no users, and CI is being built at the same time; PR ceremony would only slow the loop. From **T7 (first UI slice) onward** every task lands as a PR referencing its task ID with the AC checklist, because from that point a broken build is user-visible and reviewable diffs matter. Dima asked the agent to pick the line; this is it, and it is earlier than the "after Phase 2" ceiling he allowed.

**Rules out:** force-pushes to `master` at any time; direct commits after T6.

**Revisit if:** a second contributor arrives before T7 — then PRs start immediately.

---

## ADR-015 — Pricing source: Anthropic first-party pricing page, versioned; the legacy repo has no `pricing.json`

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

The spec says to copy `pricing.json` from Caprock-python; on inspection the legacy repo has no such file — it priced via Headroom/litellm and hard-coded Sonnet 4.5 Bedrock list prices in one measurement script, and stored only cache-savings token-equivalents. `pricing/pricing.json` is therefore authored fresh from the Anthropic first-party pricing page (per-MTok base input, 5m/1h cache write, cache read, output; fetched 2026-08-18) with `source` and `fetched_at` recorded, and versioned. The T5 parity test compares against the *formula* ported from `_savings.py` on our own fixtures, not against a legacy artifact that does not exist.

**Rules out:** inventing or "remembering" prices; unversioned in-place edits to the table.

**Revisit if:** the legacy transcript fixtures are found somewhere else, or Bedrock/Vertex pricing is added ([OQ-02](12-risks.md#open-questions)).

---

## ADR-016 — Corpus layout: numbered `.ai/` files, minimal root, spec deleted after audit

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

The spec proposed `.ai/product.md`, `.ai/architecture.md`, … and told us to adjust to the template's conventions, never the other way around. The template fixes `00/01/08/12/14`; free slots are used as `02-architecture`, `03-contracts`, `04-ui`, `05-orchestration`, `06-engineering-rules`, `09-execution-plan` (roadmap + all phase plans in one file), `10-infrastructure`. Root holds `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (the template's accepted duplicate entry point) and nothing else; the corpus template's own `TEMPLATE.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` are removed. The audit checklist the spec wants as `.ai/migration-audit.md` lives at `docs/migration-audit.md` (human-facing, archival — `docs/` is that place in this template) and may be pruned after Phase 0 ships. `CaprockV2-SPEC.md` is deleted after a green loss audit, as the spec itself and Dima instructed, rather than archived.

The orchestrator system prompt the spec places at `.ai/orchestrator.md` takes the free numbered slot `.ai/07-orchestrator.md` when T21 creates it.

**Rules out:** unnumbered `.ai/` files; extra root markdown files; keeping the spec around as a shadow source of truth.

**Revisit if:** the corpus template changes its numbering convention.

## ADR-017 — Toolchain: Go 1.26, `modernc.org/sqlite`, `coder/websocket`, `fsnotify`, `cobra`, React 19 + Vite 8 + TypeScript 7 (native), Tailwind 4, Vitest

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

Latest stable of everything, verified against the registries on 2026-08-18 ([10-infrastructure.md § Versions](10-infrastructure.md#versions-verified-2026-08-18)). `coder/websocket` over `gorilla/websocket`: context-native API, actively maintained, no wsutil boilerplate. `cobra` for the CLI because `up/down/status/hooks install|uninstall` wants real subcommands, help, and completions. TypeScript 7 (the native Go-based compiler) is used only for typechecking — Vite transpiles — so a regression there costs one config line to fall back to 6.x.

**Rules out:** `gorilla/websocket`, `mattn/go-sqlite3`, `urfave/cli`, CRA/Next.js for the UI, CSS-in-JS runtimes.

**Revisit if:** any of these blocks the Windows job or the T0 spike; the swap cost is local to one package.

## ADR-018 — Release mechanics: goreleaser, tags `v0.x.y`, three static binaries + the shim per OS

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision*

The spec names goreleaser for T10 (v0.1.0 tag + binaries). Each release ships `caprock` and `caprock-hook` for darwin/linux/windows × amd64/arm64 (windows/arm64 included because ConPTY is architecture-neutral), built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`, and the version stamped via `-ldflags`. Homebrew tap / winget / `go install` come after v0.1.0 based on demand.

**Rules out:** hand-built release artifacts; releases without a green three-OS smoke job.

**Update 2026-08-19:** shipped with v0.1.0. Each release also produces a macOS **universal** binary and pushes a **Homebrew formula** to `dspv/homebrew-tap` (`brew install dspv/tap/caprock`), which needs a `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` PAT — see [10-infrastructure.md § CI/release](10-infrastructure.md) and [docs/RELEASING.md](../docs/RELEASING.md). A CLI binary ships as a formula, not a cask — casks are for GUI `.app` bundles, and a formula also installs on Linux Homebrew. winget / `go install` still deferred.

**Revisit if:** the desktop wrapper (Phase 3) needs installers — goreleaser stays for the binaries.

---

## ADR-019 — `caprock up` detaches by default; hook-install consent is a TTY prompt (or `--yes`); sessions end after 12h of silence

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Status:** accepted · *repo-prep decision (made while building T1–T6; resolves OQ-08)*

`caprock up` re-executes itself as a detached background process logging to `<data_dir>/caprock.log` and returns once `runtime.json` appears; `--foreground` keeps it attached (dev, CI, service managers); `caprock down` asks the daemon to stop over `POST /v1/shutdown` with the per-run token (works identically on Windows, no signals). Hook install: when any of the eight events is missing and stdin is a TTY, `up` explains what it will write and asks `Install now? [Y/n]`; `--yes` answers for scripts; a non-TTY without `--yes` skips with a hint (transcript tailing still works). Session lifecycle: `active` → `idle` after 5 min → `ended` after 12 h without events, so the Now screen shows what is running today rather than every session ever ingested. The `caprock-hook` binary is copied from beside the `caprock` executable into the data dir; if absent, `<caprock> hook` (a hidden subcommand over the same `internal/shim` code) is registered instead, so a single-binary install still works.

**Rules out:** blocking prompts in non-interactive runs; a Unix-signal-only `down`; keeping every historical session in the active list.

**Revisit if:** users want `up` to stay attached by default, or a service-manager integration (launchd/systemd) replaces the detach.
