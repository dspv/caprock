Versions map to the roadmap phases in `.ai/09-execution-plan.md`. Nothing is tagged
yet — these entries describe what will ship at each tag.

## [Unreleased]

Phases 1 (Control) and 2 (Orchestrate) below are built and green on the
macOS / Linux / Windows CI matrix, on `master`, and ship at the v0.2.0 / v0.3.0
tags. Phase 2's orchestration loop has been driven end to end by a real `claude`
orchestrator (unattended, with hooks) — see `.ai/14-build-status.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-19

First tagged release — **Phase 0, Observe**: watch every `claude` session on the
machine, live, with token burn and cost, entirely on-device.

### Phase 0 — Observe

- Single static Go binary: a loopback daemon (`127.0.0.1:4173`) that serves the
  REST API, a `/v1/live` WebSocket, the hook receiver, and the embedded dashboard.
- **Hook plane** — a tiny `caprock-hook` shim registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`
  (non-destructive, backed up, cleanly removable) forwards the core Claude Code
  hook events; a broken or absent daemon never affects the user's session.
- **Transcript plane** — tails `~/.claude/projects/**`, schema-versioned parser,
  tolerant of malformed lines and unknown fields; usage counted once per response.
- Normalized event stream in SQLite (pure-Go, no CGO); cost from a versioned
  pricing table (Anthropic list prices, dated) and cache-savings math.
- **Loop detector** — flags a session repeating the same tool with similar input
  (K=5 in T=3 min), with an alert banner.
- Dashboard: **Now** (per-session narration, health, plan progress, live burn),
  **Session Detail** (event timeline, live `git diff`), **Cost** (burn, model mix,
  per-project, 30-day), **History** (lifetime stats, tool distribution).
- CLI: `caprock up | down | status | hooks install|uninstall|status | tasks`.
- Event retention (`retention_days`, default off) caps database growth.

### Phase 1 — Control (→ v0.2.0)

- Spawn real `claude` sessions from the UI into an optional git worktree, with a
  live xterm.js terminal (bidirectional) in **Session Detail**.
- Owned-session controls: pause / resume / kill — **only** for sessions Caprock
  spawned; externally started sessions stay observe-only.
- Opt-in auto-pause of a looping owned session.

### Phase 2 — Orchestrate (→ v0.3.0)

- On-disk hive (agents / tasks / mailboxes / append-only ledger), single writer,
  atomic writes.
- **Tasks board** (kanban over `tasks/*.md`), New-task dialog, approvals.
- **Orchestrator agent** — a real `claude` session with a hive-aware system prompt
  that spawns and coordinates workers via mailboxes.
- **Stop-loop autonomy** — a worker's Stop hook is answered to force it to keep
  going while its inbox is non-empty, with a hard guard (N=10) that escalates.
- **Verification before done** — a task's `done_criteria` run in the worker's
  worktree; only green checks reach `done`; red bounces the failing output back
  (R=3 rounds, then escalate). Cost is attributed to the task.

### Notes

- Local-first: loopback only, no telemetry, no outbound calls from the daemon.
- Prices and context-window sizes live in `pricing/pricing.json` (dated, sourced
  from the Anthropic pricing page). No invented numbers.
