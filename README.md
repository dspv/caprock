```bash
# macOS / Linux
brew install dspv/tap/caprock

# Windows
scoop bucket add dspv https://github.com/dspv/scoop-bucket
scoop install caprock

caprock up        # opens localhost:4173; offers to set up hooks + plan-limit status line
```

Have Go? `go install github.com/dspv/caprock/cmd/caprock@latest` — the dashboard
is embedded, so it works with no Node build. No package manager? Grab a binary
from [Releases](https://github.com/dspv/caprock/releases).

<details>
<summary><b>Coming from the old Python <code>caprock</code>?</b> Remove it first.</summary>

There was an earlier, unrelated Caprock on PyPI — a command-line stats tool that
read Claude Code usage from a proxy. This one is a Go binary with a dashboard and
shares nothing with it: different data, different install, same name. Remove the
old one so the two `caprock` commands don't shadow each other:

```bash
pipx uninstall caprock || pip uninstall -y caprock   # whichever you used
rm -rf ~/.caprock                                    # its old data
which caprock                                        # should now print nothing
```

Then install as above. **Nothing is lost:** this version reads the transcripts
Claude Code already writes, so your whole history appears on first run — no
migration, no import. (Only `~/.caprock/savings.jsonl` from the old tool is
dropped; copy it elsewhere first if you want to keep those numbers.)

</details>
On first run `caprock up` asks before adding its hook and status-line entries to
`~/.claude/settings.json` (it backs the file up and never touches your other
settings). Say no and it still reads your history from transcripts.

*Left: what every session is doing, as it happens. Right: what each repo costs
you. Real numbers from a real machine.*

## What it is

Claude Code runs in your terminal. Caprock is the window into it.
One local binary. Your data never leaves your machine.

## Why

- **See it** — live activity, tokens, cost, and loop alerts per session.
- **Steer it** — spawn, pause, and kill sessions from the dashboard.
- **Trust it** — orchestrate agents that finish only when the tests pass.
- **Local-first** — loopback only, no servers, no telemetry, no account. The one thing that can reach the network is an optional check for new releases, off until you turn it on.

What your usage is actually worth — the same work priced at the API rate,
against what your plan costs. Nobody else tells you this number:

And everything you have ever run through it — measured, not estimated:

## How it works

- **Observe** — watches every `claude` session via hooks + transcripts.
- **Control** — run and drive sessions from the browser.
- **Orchestrate** — a verified multi-agent team; a task is done only when green.

Nothing to change in your workflow — it starts by watching the sessions you already run.
